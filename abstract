ABSTRACT
ONLINE FOOD DELIVERY SYSTEM


ONLINE FOOD DELIVERY SYSTEM is mainly designed  to use in the food delivery industry. This system will allow home bakers to deliver food  online. The customers can select food items and preorder them beforehand, which will be delivered at their place . 

Introduction
The proposed system is a website developed through which the customers of a locality can order food through the site which will be communicated automatically to the home bakers. After the orders are ready the delivery staffs will be notified the  orders to be collected and delivered. The payment can be done either by cash or any online payment methods.
The existing system is that students have to walk large distance to have food, which is time waste and exhausting. Even though there are online delivery apps are prominent now, they are not affordable for the students and the unhealthy food habits are causing severe health issues for them. The main scope of the project itself is to provide healthy, homely food for the students cheap and easy.
The proposed system need not be confined to just one college or area as the number of home bakers are  increasing day by day and the availability of good food is a matter of concern for everyone in todays busy world, which makes this project highly scalable.
